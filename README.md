# LSTM-Time-Series-Forecasting
This repository contains a time series forecasting project using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks implemented in TensorFlow Keras. The project uses the International Airline Passengers Dataset to predict monthly airline passenger counts and demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques for sequential data forecasting.
